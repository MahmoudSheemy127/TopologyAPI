# TopologyAPI

TopologyAPI has been implmeneted with javascript programming language, Which i find a good choice for integrating the API with Web applications. Javascript programming language 
i find it easy and clear for implementing and writing OOP applications as well as dealing with JSON files.

TopologyAPI is an API that helps interact with different topologies , where each toplogy is an object that contains an information of an electric circuit connection
such as devices connected, how they are connected together and their values
using this API you can read Topologies' JSON files to memory and query over the different devices connected and use other functions

Whole documentation for the API is inside API.js


For automatic testing i used JEST framework for testing the API

Follow the next steps to test the API:

1.Clone this repository

2.if Node.js is not installed please install Node.js based on your machine https://nodejs.org/en/download/

3.open your terminal under directory TopologyAPI

4.run **npm install**

5.run **npm test test.js**

to use the API, you can simply import API.js from any new javascript file and use the API
